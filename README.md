# Might and Magic Trilogy [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-on%20discord-green.svg)](https://discord.gg/jRCyPtq) 
Might and Magic VI-VIII engine remake using original data & code

Getting Started
---------------
1. Use one of the projects for Visual Studio in /Builds folder. Latest are most up-to-date.
2. Required libavcodec dependencies are located in required_dlls folder
3. On older releases you will probably also need fixed MSS32.dll if project crashes for you.
4. Compile & run.
5. Launcher will try to guess your game installation directory (GoG or older releases). You can override folder with game resources using GUI.

Development
-----------
See the HACKING document in the source code root for information on how to compile.

Coding style
------------
For the C++ code we are following the [Google C++ Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).<br />
Source code is automatically checked against it, and Pull Request will fail if you don't follow it.<br />
For style check on Windows platform, you can use [Visual Studio Code cpplint plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mine.cpplint).
